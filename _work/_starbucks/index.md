    <div class="grid-row-label"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
    <div class="grid-row-copy">
        <p>I worked on a variety of projects as a freelancer with Starbucks, from drawing some icons for a Coffee Passport app, to designing a touchscreen photobooth for their Times Square flagship store.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-row">
    <div class="grid-row-label"><h3>Touchscreen Photobooth</h3></div>
    <div class="grid-row-copy">
        <p>Starbucks wanted to update the Touch-Screen Photo Booth in their Times Square flagship store with a custom-built solution that made it really quick & easy for visitors to take a souvenir selfie while they were waiting for their coffee.</p>
        <p>I worked with Starbucks to design the UX and simple UI for this new photobooth.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project was to provide a fun memento of a customer's visit to the Times Square Starbucks Store, and ultimately, to capture an email for the Starbucks newsletter. We aimed to reduce as much friction as possible - a photo can be sent with as few as 4 total taps (not including typing an email address with an on-screen keyboard).</p>

        <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
        <p>Starbucks was working on a new digital version of their Coffee Passport, which allows partners and customers to keep a journal of tasting notes as they try all of the different available roasts, and unlock stamps as they go.</p>
        <p>I helped with a few of the stamps, as well as few illustrations for an App Icon, seen below.</p>
