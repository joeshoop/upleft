    <h1>The Blue Nile iPhone app hadn't seen a major update in a few years, and it needed a more modern look for the new aesthetic of iOS 7 and the larger screen size of the new iPhone&nbsp;5.</h1>
    <p>I worked with Blue Nile and <a href="https://toyrockets.com/">Toy Rockets</a> to refresh and redesign Blue Nile's existing app, and also added a new 'Try it On' feature where shoppers could get a preview of what any ring might look like on their own hand.</p>

      <h3>Ring Builder</h3>
      <h2>Design a custom ring</h2>
      <p>The Ring Builder guides shoppers through the steps of designing their own ring, letting them build a totally custom piece from the limitless combinations of available stones and settings.</p>

      <h3>Dream Box</h3>
      <h2>Shake for a dream ring</h2>
      <p>The most popular feature in Blue Nile's previous app was the Dream Box, which would choose randomly from a list of recently purchased rings. We kept the Dream Box and Build Your Own Ring sections separate so shoppers could keep the ring they had built for themselves, while also getting some ideas & inspiration from the app.</p>
      <p>While users could tap the button, actually shaking the phone would randomize the ring, and added a fun magic 8 ball like element to the Dreambox.</p>

      <h2>See how that ring looks</h2>
      <p>After designing a ring in Ring Builder, or finding one in Dream Box, shoppers can get a preview of how it will look on their own finger by taking a photo of their hand and placing the ring manually. This personalized photo and ring placement is saved, and shows up as a product photo on every ring detail page throughout the app.</p>
