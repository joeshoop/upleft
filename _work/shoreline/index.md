        <h2>After a recent rebrand, Shoreline Community College needed a website that better reflected their core values of approachability, inclusivity, and&nbsp;accessiblity.</h2>
    </div>

<div class="project-row grid">
    <div class="project-row-copy">
        <p>I worked with the web team at <a href="https://www.shoreline.edu" target="_blank">Shoreline</a> to expand their new print-based brand guidelines into a practical system of web-friendly design patterns and atomic components, with a focus on accessibility and readability.</p>
        <p>At the same time, we used these new patterns to design a new website that focused on bringing their new brand and core values to the forefront.</p>

        <h2>Foundations of a Design System</h2>
        <p>The existing brand guidelines included a few details about color and typography, but they were made for use in print, and the typography guidelines were quite limited:</p>
        <p><img src="/work/{{page.slug}}/shoreline-brandguidelines@2x.png" alt="Depiction of three existing typographic styles" /></p>
        <p>While these guidelines don’t offer any details on how the different styles should flow together, or how brand color could be used with typography, they do contain quite a bit of useful information about how to build a typographic scale and rhythm.</p>
        <p>Using these as a foundation, I scaled the sizes for use on the web, added larger and smaller sizes, and filled in the gaps.</p>

          <h2>Building blocks</h2>
          <p>Shoreline's website was a wealth information, but it was a lot of fairly unorganized, individually built pages that were becoming increasingly onerous to maintain. They needed some common styles, components, and templates to help their small web team improve the web experience, and work toward a more consistent and accessible website.</p>
          <p>Shoreline has an excellent program for international students, as well as many students who are not typical college age, so a sense of friendliness, clarity, and readability were huge influences on the visual language developed for these components. It was also very important to convey that Shoreline is a serious institution, without looking overly serious or institutional.</p>
          <p>I think the style we ended up with strikes a nice balance, feeling both approachable and respectable.</p>

    <div class="project-row-copy">
        <h2>Page templates</h2>
        <p>Continuing to scale upward from the rebuilt typography guidelines and component systems, a series of responsive page templates were designed to support a wide variety of content types, from higher level marketing pages for prospective students, to more information-dense administrative pages for existing students and staff.</p>

        <p>Designing from the start as an atomic system of repeatable styles, components, and templates allowed a very small team to efficiently build a large website with hundreds of differerent page types, and has made it possible for Shoreline’s small web team to continue iterating and refining the site.</p>
