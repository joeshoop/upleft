        <h1>After a recent rebrand, Shoreline Community College needed a website that better reflected their core values of approachability, inclusivity, and accessiblity.</h1>
        <p>Shoreline's website was a wealth information, but it was made up of a bunch individually built pages that were becoming increasingly disorganized and more onerous to maintain.</p>
        <p>They needed a reset.</p>

        <h3>Foundation</h3>
        <h2>Foundations of a Design System</h2>
        <p>I worked with the web team at Shoreline to expand their new print-based brand guidelines into a practical system of web-friendly design patterns and atomic components, with a focus on accessibility and readability.</p>
        <p>At the same time, we used these new patterns to design a new website that focused on bringing their updated brand and core values to the forefront.</p>
        <p>The existing brand guidelines included a few details about color and typography, but the typography guidelines were quite limited, and left a lot of room for interpretation. Because they were made for use in print, they wouldn't work for the web without some reconfiguring.</p>
        <p>
        {% include project-image.html alt="The three existing text styles" image="shoreline-brandguidelines" type="png" %}</p>
        <p>What Shoreline needed was a system that could support the wide variety of different page and content types across their site.</p>
        <p>Using these existing guidelines a starting point, I established a more capable system of type styles for use on the web.</p>

          <h3>Components</h3>
          <h2>Building blocks</h2>
          <p>With some well-defined common styles, components, and templates, the small web team at Shoreline could begin to replace those aging pages, working toward a more consistent, maintainable, and accessible website.</p>
          <p>Shoreline has an excellent program for international students, as well as many students from the community with a vast array of backgrounds. A sense of friendliness, clarity, and readability were huge influences on the visual language developed for these components. It was also very important to convey that while Shoreline is a serious institution, they are also approachable.</p>
          <p>I think the style we ended up with strikes a nice balance, feeling both approachable and respectable.</p>

        <h3>Templates</h3>
        <h2>Page templates</h2>
        <p>Continuing to scale upward from the rebuilt typography guidelines and component systems, a series of responsive page templates were designed to support a wide variety of content types, from higher level marketing pages for prospective students, to more information-dense administrative pages for existing students and staff.</p>

        <p>Designing from the start as an atomic system of repeatable styles, components, and templates allowed a very small team to efficiently build a large website with hundreds of differerent page types, and has made it possible for Shorelineâ€™s small web team to continue iterating and refining the site.</p>
