    <p>In late 2011, Showtime was working on a new on-demand streaming video service for all of their content called Showtime Anytime. Showtime and Übermind (my employer at the time) worked together to design and build the first native iPhone and iPad apps for this new service. I led the visual design for this effort.</p>

        <h3>iPad app</h3>
        <h2>Starting Big</h2>
        <p>We started with the iPad, since the larger screen would deliver the best experience for streaming video, and was a natural transition from the web version that was already in development.</p>
        <p>There were write-ups on <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/10/showtime-ipad-app/">Venture Beat</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/10/new-showtime-anytime-app-brings-showtimes-movies-and-shows-to-the-ipad">Tech Crunch</a> about the launch of the iPad app.</p>

        <h3>iPhone app</h3>
        <h2>Anytime means phones, too</h2>
        <p>After the iPad App launched, we started translating the design to the smaller iPhone screen. Both apps have the same features and aesthetic, but the navigation had to change a bit to accomidate the smaller screen on the phone.</p>
