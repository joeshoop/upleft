    <p>Daily Number</p>
    <h1>Unlike other daily fantasy apps that set salary caps and pit players against each other, Daily Number challenges players to pick a lineup that can beat an ever changing projected score—the Daily&nbsp;Number.</h1>
    <p>I helped the team at Daily Number completely redesign their app, improving the information architecture, making it more user-friendly, better aligned with their brand, nicer looking, and more fun to play.</p>

    <h3>New Lineup</h3>
    <h2>Starting a new game</h2>
    <p>Setting up the perfect lineup is core to the gameplay loop of Daily Number. Choose between multiple sports, check out detailed player stats, set your lineup, opt to sweeten the pot with longshot odds or go for a likely win with a lower payout.</p>

    <h3>In-app Wallet</h3>
    <h2>Cash in, cash out</h2>
    <p>Before they can submit that sick lineup, users need some funds in their in-app wallet. They can connect a bank account or a card for deposits and withdrawals, and keep track of their transaction history.</p>
    <p>Daily Number doesn't charge a transfer fee, but the payment processor does. Because of this behind the scenes cost, we wanted to discourage people from initiating a transfer for each bet individually, instead making an occasional deposit to the wallet that could cover multiple bets.</p>
    <p>We also wanted to encourage responsible play, so needed to enforce maximum transfer limits. Using a range slider instead of a keyboard or num-pad helps reinforce these min and max limits by making it impossible to enter a number that is out of range.</p>
