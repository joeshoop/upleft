        <p>Reachify was working on a new product to help online businesses make informed decisions about which tools and services should be part of their tech stack.</p>
        <p>Reachify had been cataloging all kinds of info about how various websites are built, including details about the CMS, domain registrar, analytics software, Javascript frameworks, AB testing tools, and about 100 other categories. A user could find some pretty deep insights into which tools were the best match for their business, and some solid justification for choosing one vendor over another</p>
        <p>Our goal was to help users understand all of this data.</p>

        <p>Reachify was building a web-based product to help guide companies making decisions about what software and services they used to build their websites. Reachify had been cataloging all kinds of info about how websites were built, from which CMS they were using, to their domain registrar, analytics software, Javascript frameworks, AB testing tools, and about 100 other categories.</p>
        <p>We helped Reachify make sense of all that info, and designed an easy way to ‘look under the hood’ on a specific website, and a tool for customized recommendations based on what was common in a customer’s industry, what their competitors were using, and compatibility with their existing software.</p>
