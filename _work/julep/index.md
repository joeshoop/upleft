    <h1>Julep was expanding their monthly beauty box subscription with new tiers, letting subscribers customize which items they wanted in their upcoming box.</h1>
    <p>I worked with <a href="http://toyrockets.com/">Toy Rockets</a> to design a new iPhone App for Julep that included this upgraded flexibility and helped clarify how to take advantage of these new features.</p>

        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <h2>Minimum Viable Product</h2>
        <p>At first, the Maven App was exclusive to existing Julep Maven subscribers. Customers could see what was included in next month's box and pick a different style if they preferred, and sometimes choose a color for an item.</p>

        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
        <h2>Customize the entire box</h2>
        <p>Later, after the changes and upgrades to the Maven subscription were introduced, the app was updated so subscribers had more control over customizing their box. Instead of just picking between a few color options for an item, users can now individually choose each item in their box.</p>

        <h3>Phase 3</h3>
        <h2>A complete shopping experience</h2>
        <p>Finally, all products available on the website became browseable, searchable, and available for purchase in the app. The app received another update which included browseable categories, a cart and a full checkout flow.</p>
