Studio Upleft is a small digital product design studio in Seattle, WA, and is the work of designer Joe Shoop.

Joe designed his first website in 1998. It wasn't very good.

Before going independent in 2014, Joe worked as a designer at Big Fish Games for a few years, then for another few years as a visual designer at Ãœbermind (now known as Deloitte Digital) on projects for Target and Showtime, among others. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Art/Design from Western Washington University, and now lives in Seattle.
