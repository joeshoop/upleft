## Studio Upleft is the design practice of Joe Shoop, an independent product designer making it work in socially distanced Seattle, WA.

I have been designing for screens for more than 20 years, starting with a VERY COOL geocities website that most definitely had at least one spooky rotating skull gif.

> — My Mom, probably

Since that early peak, I have worked as a designer with a wide variety of brands on a wide variety of projects, including such hits as [a touchscreen photobooth for Starbucks](#), [Target’s first ever iPad app](#), or more recently, a [daily fantasy sports game](#), and [a design system and website for Shoreline Community College](#), among [other things](#).

I am currently doing project-based client work, and am particularly interested in working on tools rather than feeds. If you or your company prioritizes accessibility, inclusion, and sustainability, I'd love to hear from you.
