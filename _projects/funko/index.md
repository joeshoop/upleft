# Designing a native iPhone app for **Funko**

{% include component-project-details.html %}

{% include component-placeholder.html %}

**Funko** was introducing a new monthly subscription box for their Funko Pop! toys, and they needed a place for customers to sign up, get updates about upcoming boxes, and manage their subscriptions. I worked with Funko through Mentor and a small team at Revel Consulting to design a website and a native iOS app for this new subscription box.
