# Seattle Children's Hospital
Seattle Childrenâ€™s needed to update their homepage, and I helped with the visual design. Outside of the homepage, only the global header and footer were changing, so all of the existing content had to stay the same, which meant that we had to use their existing style, but update it to be more readable and accessible.
