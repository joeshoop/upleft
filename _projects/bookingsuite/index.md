# Building hotel management tools at **Booking Suite**

{% include component-project-details.html %}

{% include component-placeholder.html %}

## Project Overview
**Booking Suite** makes web-based software for hotels, including a CMS for the hotel website where guests can book rooms, and a tool for managing those reservations.

While there, I was involved with two big projects - one was a big update to the CMS, internally called 'Back Office'. The other project was an iPhone app for the reservation management.

## Back Office

I did a lot of front-end and scss work on this project.
